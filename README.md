This is alaadin1's first git project. I am learning the common workflow for remote and local repos.

The steps are as follows:
- Copy the url of the remote repo and clone it into your local drive using $git clone <url> <"location to clone">
    - Now you have a copy of the repo on you local serve

- Next you make changes to the files and commit it locally
    - $git status
    - $git add "file you want to push to staging area"
    - $git commit -m "Text explaing what changed"
- Then you need to put it the remote repo by "pushing" it
    - First pull in the most recent files to ensure you have the most up to date files using $git pull origin master 
    - then push using $git push orgin master


Adding this last name for tests
